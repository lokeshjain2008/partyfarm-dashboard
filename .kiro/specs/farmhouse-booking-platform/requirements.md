# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The PartyFarm Booking Management Platform is a comprehensive web application designed to facilitate the onboarding, management, and booking of premium farmhouses for events and celebrations. The platform serves two primary user types: in-house users who manage property onboarding and customer bookings, and farmhouse owners/staff who manage their properties and bookings.
